### 1. 三种动态加载方式
* Entry Points: Manually split code using [entry](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/entry-context) configuration.
* Prevent Duplication: Use the [SplitChunksPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/) to dedupe and split chunks.
* Dynamic Imports: Split code via inline function calls within modules.

### 2. 单词  
intuitive:凭直觉的 pitfalls:陷阱 conform:遵守 legacy:遗产  
vendor:小贩; 摊贩; (某种产品的) 销售公司; (房屋等的) 卖主;


### 3. Entry Points缺点:  
- If there are any duplicated modules between entry chunks they will be included in both bundles.
- It isn't as flexible and can't be used to dynamically split code with the core application logic.

### 4. 社区loader/plugin:
* [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/mini-css-extract-plugin): Useful for splitting CSS out from the main application.
* [bundle-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/bundle-loader): Used to split code and lazy load the resulting bundles.
* [promise-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/promise-loader): Similar to the bundle-loader but uses promises.

### 5. [import() syntax](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#import-1) that conforms to the [ECMAScript proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) for dynamic imports  
[placeholders](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#outputfilename)  

### 6. `then(({ default: _ }) => {`
default原因: [webpack 4: import() and CommonJs](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-4-import-and-commonjs-d619d626b655)

### 7. webpack to output “Resource Hint”
prefetch: resource is probably needed for some navigation in the future  
preload: resource might be needed during the current navigation  
`import(/* webpackPrefetch: true */ 'LoginModal');`  
=>`<link rel="prefetch" href="login-modal-chunk.js">`  
prefetch preload ***区别***  
* A preloaded chunk starts loading in parallel to the parent chunk. A prefetched chunk starts after the parent chunk finishes loading.
* A preloaded chunk has medium priority and is instantly downloaded. A prefetched chunk is downloaded while the browser is idle.
* A preloaded chunk should be instantly requested by the parent chunk. A prefetched chunk can be used anytime in the future.
* Browser support is different.
