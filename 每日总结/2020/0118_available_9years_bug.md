### 9年的bug了解一下
[Why is there no mention of this stretch prop on MDN](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer/issues/1035#issuecomment-485343979)
> Support on Firefox(Gecko engine specifically) for -moz-available only supports width properties, there is a `9 year bug` for it, although a recent FF 66 release has since added height property support for min-content and max-content(part of the intrinsic size support, but unrelated to stretch/fill-available).
